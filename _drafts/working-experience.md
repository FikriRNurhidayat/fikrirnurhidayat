## Backend Engineer

Tutore is an application that will help its user learn English in a fun way. Together with [qatros](https://qatros.com/) I build Tutore's backend application which handle all the business about finding the right tutor for the user, and setting up TURN/STUN server for real time communication.

Here's what I use to make it happens:

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) as Backend Application Framework
- [Red5Pro TURN/STUN Server](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/plugins/webrtc/turnstun/) to setup realtime communication for between user.
- Websocket to exchange ICE Canditate between user on realtime, so client can use it to iniate call to other user.
